The project was created DEC-2020.
2nd project of Udacity Nanodegree Program "Programming for Data Science with Python"


### Bike Share Data
The aim of the Project is to track data of bike rentals in three major cities in  USA.


### Description
We provide statistical data for three major cities in the USA and the bike rentals there.
Statistics Computed

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    *most common month*
    *most common day of week*
    *most common hour of day*

#2 Popular stations and trip

    *most common start station*
    *most common end station*
    *most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)*

#3 Trip duration

    *total travel time*
    *average travel time*

#4 User info

    *counts of each user type*
    *counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)*
    *earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)*

### Files used
We have used three CSV database files provided from Udacity:

    *chicago.csv*
    *new_york_city.csv*
    *washington.csv*

Analyzed them with our Python interactive script:

    *bikeshare.py*.


### Credits
We have used the  **strftime** function from the Python Standard Library.
