### DEC - 2020
The project was created DEC-2020 for the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Programming for Data Science with Python"

### Bike Share Data
Project is titled bikeshare, because it tracks the data of bike rentals in three major cities in  USA.

### Description
We provide statistical data for three major cities in the USA and the bike rentals there.

Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
We have used three CSV database files provided from Udacity and analyzed them with a Python interactive script bikeshare.py created by us.

To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
We have used the  **strftime** function from the Python Standard Library. The link is provided here: [strftime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime)
